### Announcement üì¢
Recently I've decided to re-write the app from the ground up. The new version will be using a different tech stack with the aim of making the app multi-platform, working on Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux. Ultimately, the new app will either be compatible with the old account data format or allow seamless migration. All existing features will be present and new or requested features will be addressed in the new version. The current version of the app will only be updated when/if there is any major change in the Riot Games API or client that would break the functionality of the app.

If you're interested about the current state of the project, any updates will be present in the README section [here.](https://github.com/MELVARDEV/League-Pass-Manager/tree/rewrite)

# League-Pass-Manager üîë
A tool that makes it easier to manage your League of Legends and Valorant passwords, made for people who use infamous password storage method -> "accounts.txt" on the desktop.

## Features üìÉ
- Encrypts account data with a single password
- Auto-fills selected account or launches LoL and logs in automatically
- Shows Rank/Division and current level for stored accounts
- You can save data such as account region, username, password and a description for each account

### Disclaimer üì¢
In some cases, the app won't launch unless started as an administrator.

## How to use ‚ÑπÔ∏è
1. Extract the app to a desired location
1. Create a shortcut to League Pass Manager.exe on your desktop if you wish to
1. Run the program and type in your encryption key / password that you will use each time you open the app. Remember the key or write it down somewhere safe as losing it will result in losing all saved account data.
1. Add an account by clicking on the first empty row and filling in the data
2. Your summoner data will be shown after you fill in `region` and `summoner name` fields

## Additional information ‚Ñπ
